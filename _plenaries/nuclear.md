shortbio: "Are nuclear weapons still threats? Who should have access to them? How do they impact foreign relations and power dynamics?"

Hiroshima, Nagasaki, B-52s, tactical nuclear weapons, thermonuclear war–all these have been part of the lexicon of the modern world. As the 21st century progresses, are nuclear weapons a thing of the past or part of the strategic calculus for the future? Delivery systems, payloads, and bomb transportation have all advanced to such an extent that the use of nuclear weapons seems increasingly plausible. Has the celebrated “deterrent effect”--MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction--finally expired? What responsibility do international bodies have to regulate and control the proliferation of nuclear weaponry? As global tensions rise, the world must remain wary and ever vigilant.
