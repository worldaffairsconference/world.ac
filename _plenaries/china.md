Africa experiences the fastest growing demography and economy in the world; its need for foreign investment makes the continent a target for all companies and nations that seek new market possibilities. Over the last decade, investing into mines, roads, airports, hospitals, highways, and dams, China has become one of Africaâ€™s biggest trading partners. As skepticism about its intentions in increasing economic, cultural, and, therefore, political presence in the continent, the plenary questions its positive and negative, short-term and long-term implications. At a moment in time when President Trump puts America first, Sino-African relations not only shape the African continent, but the nature of international affairs.
