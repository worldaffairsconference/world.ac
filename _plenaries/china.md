shortbio: "In what ways might other major stakeholders view China’s role in Africa as neocolonialism? How can China ensure that ownership of resources, human rights, and pollution can be at the heart of its ‘win-win cooperation’ with Africa?"

Africa experiences the fastest growing demography and economy in the world; its need for foreign investment makes the continent a target for all companies and nations that seek new market possibilities. Over the last decade, investing into mines, roads, airports, hospitals, highways, and dams, China has become one of Africa’s biggest trading partners. As skepticism about its intentions in increasing economic, cultural, and, therefore, political presence in the continent, the plenary questions its positive and negative, short-term and long-term implications. At a moment in time when President Trump puts America first, Sino-African relations not only shape the African continent, but the nature of international affairs.
