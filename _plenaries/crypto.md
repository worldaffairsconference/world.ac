Cryptocurrency is an emerging technology changing the way we transact money. Or is it? Since the emergence of the first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) in 2009, banks have been on their feet to retain customers. You see, cryptocurrency is so different than any way we have ever managed our money because it is decentralized, meaning that no state owns cryptocurrencies, and therefore, no state can be in control of the currency. As well, cryptocurrencies can sustain transactions without ever having to use a bank. But there are some issues, too. If there is no bank involved, who will ensure there isnâ€™t any fraud? How can you track someone down if their transactions are anonymous? What is our generation going to have to know to be prepared for the exponential increase of cryptocurrencies in the years to come?
