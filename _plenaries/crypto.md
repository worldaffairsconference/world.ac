Cryptocurrency is an emerging technology changing the way we transact money. Or is it? Since the emergence of the first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) in 2009, banks have been on their feet to retain customers. Cryptocurrency is so different than any way we have ever managed our money because it is decentralized, meaning that no government owns cryptocurrencies, and therefore, no government can be in control of the currency. As well, cryptocurrencies can sustain transactions without ever having to use a bank.

But there are some questions we must ask, too. If there is no bank involved, who will ensure there isnâ€™t any fraud? How can you track someone down if their transactions are anonymous?
Our plenary prepares our generation - the first generation that will be fully immersed in this technology - for what we need to know to be prepared for the exponential increase of cryptocurrencies in the years to come.
