    question: "What is WAC?"
    answer: "The World Affairs Conference (WAC) is Canada's oldest annual student-run current affairs conference. Annually held at Upper Canada College in Toronto, Canada, the World Affairs Conference connects over 1000 students, with a common interest in current affairs, from across North America. A dedicated team of about 100 high school students from Upper Canada College, in coordination with Branksome Hall, voluntarily contribute their time for many months leading up to the day of WAC to ensure the success and positive experience for each delegate that attends the conference."

  wheniswac:
    question: "When is WAC?"
    answer: "WAC spans two days: the Keynote Address, featuring a prominent member of the community, is held on the night of February 5th and open to the public; and the Conference Day, which is held on February 6th and is attended by delegates and faculty supervisors only."

  whocanattend:

    question: "How is registration paid for?"
    answer: "Please send a cheque for the total amount of students times $50 CAD payable to Upper Canada College. Our address is 200 Lonsdale Rd, Toronto, ON M4V 1W6.

  whenisdue:
    question: "When are registration fees due?"
    answer: "The WAC team recommends that advisors send their registration fees in by January 26th, to ensure that it arrives on a timely matter; the hard deadline for registration fees is the day of the conference (February 6th), and we will not let delegates inside the conference if fees are not paid by then."

  caniregisterasanindividualstudent:
    question: "Can I register as an individual student?"
    answer: "We suggest that students attempt to register through their school, as that makes payment, supervision, and liability simply. In addition, if there are barriers preventing students from attending, such as money or administration issues, WAC is willing to help however we can. Ultimately, if none of this is successful, we ask delegates to contact us for more information: we can help independents on a case-by-case basis."

  caniinformwacofspecialfoodaccomodations:
    question: "Can I inform WAC of special food accomodations?"
    answer: "Delegates can notify WAC of their food (or otherwise) accomodations through the account system. We can guarantee that there will be vegetarian food that is available during the conference lunch. Unfortunately, we are not certain that we can accomodate every dietary concern. We suggest delegates with dietary concerns either bring a pack lunch, or go to a nearby restaurant."
