        <h4>What's WAC?</h4>
        <p>
          The World Affairs Conference (WAC) is Canada's oldest annual student-run current affairs conference. Annually held at Upper Canada College in Toronto, Canada, the World Affairs Conference connects over 1000 students, with a common interest in current affairs, from across North America.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year, WAC 2018's theme is <b>Paradigm Shifts</b>: how have the axioms of society changed, and how will they change in the future? Some of our programs will include discussions on new innovative technologies, the ever-changing political landscape, and shifts in social policy and movements.

        <h4>Geoffrey Hinton, Keynote Address</h4>
        <p>
          The increasing possibilities of artificial intelligence will have consequential impacts on society. Ranging from an upheaval of the job market to an increasingly computer dependent world, artificial intelligence is one of today’s most profound paradigm shifts. Geoffrey Hinton, nicknamed the “Godfather of Machine Learning”, divides his time between working for Google and the University of Toronto. His expertise will address how AI will change the society we live in now.

        <h3>Edward Snowden</h3>
        <p>
          Two years ago, Edward Snowden gave the WAC 2015 Lionel Gelber Keynote Address. In June 2013, Snowden leaked highly classified information about the scale and scope of NSA and CIA counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence operations around the globe. Since then, he has become a household name and is among the most influential privacy activists in the world. At the Keynote Address, Snowden explained his views on global privacy issues, government involvement in citizens' lives, and the dangers of the digital age.
